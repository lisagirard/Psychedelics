Data projects in relation to psychedelics therapeutic research 

Thinkful Supervised Capstone Project: <br>
https://bit.ly/LG-PsychedelicMHCs <br>
An examination in publically-available raw data regarding psychedelics use in US citizens, 2020 <br>
Objective: predicting psychedelics use based on certain mental health conditions and/or recent prior knowledge of psychedelic therapeutic use

<strong>Conclusions:</strong>
<ul><li>Can predict with 85% accuracy that those with certain mental health conditions AND prior knowledge of psychedelics-as-therapeutic-tool are using psychedelics</li>
<li>Establishes connection between recreational use as form of self-medicated mental health care</li>
<li>Connection between psychedelics and mental health care can advance science about: 
<ul><li>how these compounds work in relation to mental health</li>
<li>how to use them safely</li>
<li>how to regulate and optimize</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
